Welcome to the github page for my user profile, not for a specific repo.

This is a showcase of my skills as I develop.

I already know a little bit of Git and Markdown. Here I will have different sections for About Me, Goals, Methods, etc.

At the moment, I do not publish it throuth Jekyll or use a theme.

Here is an external site I might use sometime. It is hosted using just the base tools of [OpenBSD](https://openbsdhandbook.com).

Apparently it takes github a bit of time sometimes to start displaying the changes on the live page after the commit.

In 2022, I've started at [Epicodus](https://epicodus.com), a trade school for Software
Engineering.
