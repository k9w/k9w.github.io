# k9w.github.io

Welcome to the github page for my user profile, not for a specific repo.

[https://k9w.github.io]()

This is a showcase of my skills as I develop.

I already know a little bit of Git and Markdown. Here I will have different sections for About Me, Goals, Methods, etc.

At the moment, I do not publish it throuth Jekyll or use a theme.

For that, refer to my first repo on github pages:
