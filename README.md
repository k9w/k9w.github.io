Welcome to the github page for my user profile, not for a specific repo.

<!-- I don't know if links specified as () default to the home page or the current page. -->

This is a showcase of my skills as I develop.

I already know a little bit of Git and Markdown. Here I will have different sections for About Me, Goals, Methods, etc.

At the moment, I do not publish it throuth Jekyll or use a theme.

 <!-- Here I specify '/hello-world' in the () since that page is under this page. -->
For that, refer to my first repo on github pages:
[https://k9w.github.io/hello-world](/hello-world)

Here is an external site I might use sometime. It is hosted using just the base tools of OpenBSD.
